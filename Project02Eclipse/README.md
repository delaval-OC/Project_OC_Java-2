Sample project for OpenClassroom's fundamentals of Java:

first version of the project : v0.1
===================================

this version use only the class Analyticscounter.

It read the file symptoms.txt localised in the root directory of the project.

From symtomps.txt,we can only count the occurrence of 3 symptoms as specified in the main methode of AnalyticsCounter.java ie:
- headache
- rash
- problems for pupills

Future progression
==================

We are going to use the class ReadSymptomDataFromFile to be able:
- to use any file wathever its name or its location.
- to count all the symptoms present in the file and  not only 3.
